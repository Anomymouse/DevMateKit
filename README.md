##What is DevMate

[DevMate](devmate.com) is development and distribution platform for Mac OS X developers.

DevMate Dashboard provides a full control over your application and customers, displays app usage statistics, crash reports and user feedback in real time - all from a single, elegant place.

 * **Distribute your app**. Upload and host application binaries on DevMate to make the app available for downloading. DevMate uses Amazon CDN to deliver installation files, which guarantees 99.9% uptime.

 * **Analyze sales and app usage.** Get detailed sales and downloads reports, conversions ratios and campaign reports. Analyze customers behaviour and application usage.

 * **Monitor crash reports.** Issue and exception reports are collected in real time and grouped by similarity in DevMate DashBoard. Each issue group shows the impact on your app users.

 * **Manage customers.** A simple CRM crafted specially for the developers and support guys. It collects and stores all essential info about customer and initiated purchases: order number, activation keys, and more.

 * **Users’ feedback.** Collect and reply users’ feedback, discuss them with your team, and assign statuses to ensure that no message is left without a reply.

In order to connect your application to DevMate you are to integrate DevMateKit which provides you a set of ready-to-use tools that allows you to prepare your application for distribution:

* **Activations** to protect and license your application. Create time and/or feature limited trial versions.
